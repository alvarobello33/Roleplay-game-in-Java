## Project Overview 🚀

In this roleplay game, you will find a dynamic world where players can create their own characters, monsters, and levels, and then simulate an entire adventure using these elements. ⚔️

This project is part of the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** course, developed in **La Salle** University. This project demonstrates the development of a Java application following the layered architecture model, formed by presentation, business, and persistence layers.

## Key Features 🌟
Character Creation: Design unique heroes with a wide range of attributes, and types. Customize your characters to fit your vision, whether they’re powerful adventurers, cunning mages, or stealthy clerics. ⚔️🧙‍♂️

Monster Creation: Build terrifying creatures to challenge players, with customizable stats, behaviors, and abilities. 🐉👹

Level Creation: Design the environment where your adventure takes place. Create complex dungeons, with different difficulties depending on the selected monsters. 🏰🌲

Simulate Adventures: Once your characters, monsters, and levels are ready, simulate your very own RPG adventure! Watch as the heroes battle monsters while exploring the dangeon. Will they survive the challenges you’ve designed? 🛡️🔥
